This was to keep down the number of generators which had to be kept running for only two or three hours a day to meet the evening peak demand. Hence, higher rates for lighting were charged since the major portion of the costs incurred by the Electricity Department were principally to meet the lighting load in the evening. The situation has now changed. There are now three peak loads. One at 10.00 a.m., one at 4.00 p.m. in the evening, and one at 7.00 p.m. It means that the cost of supplying electrical lighting and power to various consumer categories is nearly the same. So there is no point to meter lighting and power separately and charge differently.   ",

For instance, if a consumer like a factory requires 100,000 kwh a month, it could schedule its load for three shifts and require at most only 200 kw of demand. However, if it works on one shift, it will require up to 600 kw of demand increasing the need for more power generating plants, switchgears and other equipment.   ",

In fact, as I have stated, the PUB's revenue estimates for 1973 show that receipts will be $1.8 million less under the new tariffs. The PUB will also have to spend about $1 million to convert the existing 240,000 dual meter accounts to single meter accounts. In the long term, however, there will be savings in capital expenditure as the recovered meters can be used for new consumers or to replace old meters. There will also be savings in administration costs because instead of reading two meters, only one meter need be read.   ",

I would like to know whether the small consumers will pay less after the introduction of these new tariffs. If they have to pay more, then it will not be beneficial to them. It will be a greater burden to them. Secondly, since our generators produce enough supply of electricity, we should encourage consumers to use more electricity so that more revenue can be collected by the PUB. In this way, with more revenue, I believe it is not necessary for the PUB to introduce these new consolidated tariffs. The third question is this.

Our main concern is to see that the small consumers or those people who live, as the hon. Member said, in $20-a-month Housing Board flats, should not be asked to pay more. I have said that those who use a combined total of 30 kwh or less of electricity per month for both power and lighting will pay less. There is the question that if some people pay less, who pays more? Let me tell him who pays more. I, for one, will be paying more because of air conditioning, for which I use more power than lighting. As I have explained, the cost of supplying electricity, either for power or lighting, is about the same. So the charges should be the same. At present, the rate for lighting is higher. We are paying 18 cents per unit for lighting, and only 7 cents per unit for power. It means that lighting has been subsidising power. So now, those people who use power are now asked to pay their due share and those people who have been paying a higher rate for lighting, well, they do not have to subsidise those who use power. Therefore, in toto, if you use a very large proportion of power, compared to lighting, you will now have to pay more, and this is as it should be. That is why I have said that the new tariff is fair, equitable and just.   ",

However, the question is whether this adjustment will involve only a small group of senior officers or all civil servants, including those in Divisions II, III, and IV. Several years ago, the Government set up a Civil Service Salary Adjustment Committee. They submitted their recommendations which benefited only a few senior officers. Civil servants in the lower ranks did not benefit by the adjustment. Therefore, I would like to suggest here that the re-adjustment of the Civil Service salary structures should not be discriminatory, benefiting only the senior officers, and not the lower ranks of civil servants. In actual fact, the re-adjustment in salary structure is more pressing for the lower ranks than for senior officers to whom a small adjustment is insignificant. It is just like a drop of water in the ocean to senior officers. But to officers in the lower ranks, it is like a dewdrop in a season of drought: or it is like providing them with charcoal during winter. The re-adjustment will benefit them very much. Therefore, a comprehensive salary re-adjustment is very necessary and this is also a pressing requirement of the general rungs of the civil servants.   ",

    "content": "Secondly, I would like to look into the question of why some people are not satisfied with the Government. We all know that although the present Government won a decisive victory in the last general elections, there are still about 30 per cent of our electorate who cast votes for the opposition. There must be some reason for this. Sir, I remember that when we separated from Malaysia, our Government had to make the people struggle very hard for their survival. And now we have achieved definite results. At present, it is not a question of survival of our people as our prosperity has topped the whole of Southeast Asia and it can even compare very favourably with that of the Western and American countries. Living in this fortunate environment, except for a very few extremists, chauvinists, and racialists, why should they want to oppose the Government? I think it might be because the Government in implementing its policies had been too harsh or hasty and neglecting the basic livelihood of the people. For example, in implementing our urban renewal programme the Government has given priority of Housing Board flats to people affected by the resettlement programme. The Government has also given them compensation and removal expenses. In view of this, the Government can be said to have done its best to help the people to resettle comfortably. However, the Government has not gone a step further to resolve the problem of livelihood of these people. Because of this they are dissatisfied with the Government. For instance, those who were affected by resettlement were originally sub-tenants, and many of them are families of six or seven each. They had been paying rentals of $15 or $20 per month, but upon resettlement in Housing Board flats they had to pay double or even treble the rate. This had inevitably increased their burden. They had no choice but to move out. However, it was difficult to remove, and thus their cause for dissatisfaction. Here I would like to suggest that in future whenever the Government implements any policy that affects the people, it should give the people ample time to adjust to the changed situation. Secondly, there should be co-ordination between Members of Parliament and local leaders, who could make on-the-spot investigations so that they could better understand the actual living conditions of the general populace and to enable the Government to draw up plans and policies in accordance with the surveys obtained. This would meet the requirements of the people and would facilitate persuasion, so that the people would not have any reason to complain against the Government.   ",

    "content": "Finally, Sir, I would like to touch upon the reorganisation of the road traffic system. It cannot be denied that since the reorganisation of our public transport, the bus services are much better than before. This, of course, is a mailer for joy. Today, many people need to spend a few cents to travel by bus from one corner of Singapore to another. However, this reorganisation has brought about many problems. First of all, it adversely affects the livelihood of the taxi drivers because with so many buses running along so many roads and with such convenience and cheap means of transport many people want to travel by bus. As a result, the income of the taxi drivers has dropped very badly. If this trend were to continue further, the difficulties now faced by the taxi drivers would become worse. Therefore, I would like to remind the Government to pay attention to the problem of the livelihood of the taxi drivers. Secondly, the bus services along so many roads, big or small, have caused greater congestion along these roads. For instance, in MacPherson district there is a small road called Circuit Road which is not very wide. Originally, the vehicular traffic there is already quite heavy. But now, with buses running along this road, the traffic is even more congested. This is only one example. There are many other streets and roads in the same situation. I hope the Minister for Communications will pay attention to this undesirable situation and try to rectify it so that our road system can be improved.   ",

In his speech to the House, the President has charted out the path of progress for the nation in the next few years. We owe our present well-being to hard work in the past; hard work it shall have to be if we are to continue to prosper. As we become more affluent, we shall have more to spend and to save. Whilst spending is a relatively simple matter, although some people seem to have difficulties spending within their means, saving can pose quite considerable problems. It is perhaps unnecessary for me to enumerate the many painful experiences which some of our citizens have had in recent years. By putting their savings in the wrong places or in wrong hands, they have had their hard-earned savings taken away from them overnight. What has happened is history. My present concern is the future security of the savings of our citizens, particularly the large majority of the working class people. Ideally, I would like to see most of the savings going to the Post Office Savings Bank or perhaps the other well established financial institutions, but as there are many other competing alternatives offering what appear to be attractive propositions in terms of high rates of returns for those who are eager to see their money grow, security becomes a matter of some concern. As such, I feel that it is essential at this juncture for the Government to take a good look at some of the existing outlets for our national savings, with a view to ensuring as far as it is possible by legislative means that these outlets are safe for our citizens to leave their money with. One area that immediately comes to mind is the Stock Exchange where we find today people from all walks of life playing \"Bulls and Bears\", and many have had their lingers burned. Here, are we satisfied that everything possible has been done to curb excessive speculation and manipulation which, more often than not, benefits a resourceful few at the expense of a vast number of small investors? There has been a suggestion that an independent watchdog committee be set up to keep an eye on the activities of the Exchange, but to-date this has remained a point of academic interest leaving the Exchange to continue to operate as a self-regulating body.

We cannot always afford to learn from bitter experience. In the course of the next few years I should like to see a rather more effective and knowledgeable commercial crime unit within our own police force working hand-in-hand with the Trade Division of the Ministry of Finance and constantly keeping a watchful eye on imported crimes directed at taking away the precious savings of our people. In this connection, it is therefore reassuring to note from the addendum to the President's speech, the proposed setting up of a Criminal Intelligence Unit.   ",

At present most, if not all, of such applications are turned down. Consequently many families have to put up with very crammed conditions, since alternative accommodation is becoming increasingly difficult to come by, bearing in mind the long waiting list at the Housing Board. The very involved procedures at present which are necessary in order to obtain approval for repairs or renovations, no matter how minor the nature of repairs may be, also leave much to be desired, and I would urge that something be done to simplify matters and to avoid unnecessary delays. All in all, I feel that the time has come for a rather more comprehensive set of policies aiming at the betterment of life in general in the rural areas so that, to quote the President, the bloom as reflected from the glow of success \"will spread from the city to the new towns, and through to the villages and kampongs in the rural areas.\"   ",

Mr Speaker, Sir, if I recollect rightly, not all the countries in the world which claim to have adopted a parliamentary democratic system have benefited from parliamentarism. One of the reasons is that in many of these countries a defective multi-party system or even a two-party system is encouraged to serve the purpose of those who prefer constitutional instability to the continuity of an effective government. Time and energy are wasted in the intensified inter-party struggles which lead eventually to unrest and disorder. In the case of the Third Republic of France, there had been a century of constitutional instability.

Democracy must be a national asset and there must be no room for insurrection to be triggered off by foreign nations. Members will recall that prior to the general elections in 1959, there was a well-known case of a decadent Lim Yew Hock regime receiving financial support from a certain foreign power. The history of bracketed tractable operation and black operation designed by foreign powers can be traced to as far back as the 1950s. It would be naive for us to believe that being an independent country today, Singapore would be free from political intervention from outside. This is part of the hard facts of life which should always be borne in mind by all those who do not lack a sense of commitment to the nation. We have to rely mainly on our determination to safeguard our national interest against any political manipulation by outside powers. Too often we find people possessing love for the nation only when the sun smiles upon them. But the patriot who stands firm, even when the cruel winds of fate blast upon our shores and dark clouds loom over the horizon, deserves the gratitude of every man and woman in the nation. Only God and the devil can live alone in this world. As men, we must live together and care for one another. This is a prerequisite to nation-building, and our first task is to build up a sense of political alertness and to develop the best qualities of incorruptible integrity. This is the essence of statesmanship and political maturity. All these are crucial and should be treated with the utmost sincerity.

Since the PSA raised their tariffs late last year, many vessels have avoided coming to the docks in order to avoid paying the very high charges. Statistically, during the first half of this year as compared with that of last year, there is a greater turn-round of ships and greater handling of cargo. But one most important thing has been covered up by these statistics issued by the PSA; and that is, there is a great volume of cargo being handled at the roads, for which the PSA is losing money. These ships at the roads avoid paying the many charges involved, if they had docked. Thereby Singapore is losing a great deal of money.   ",

A person with a University degree can be assured of a promotion when competing with a non-graduate for a certain post, although the non-graduate may be more experienced and quite often more capable than the graduate. This system of giving University graduates preferential treatment in everything has thus produced a dis-satisfied civil service, particularly in the case of the non-graduate who is a very capable person. I would suggest that it is important for it to be well known generally that, in theory and in practice, it is possible for meritorious officers to be promoted to higher grades, even though they may not have the educational qualifications normally required for direct entry into the grade, provided always that they are in all respects capable of performing the duties of the higher grade. Therefore, the stress should be laid on performance and potential rather than on formal qualifications. There should always be promotional opportunities open to serving officers capable of high performance. Therefore, at all levels of the service a number of vacancies in the recruitment grades should be made available for in-service promotion for such officers. It is also important that an officer should benefit immediately on promotion and that the promotional increase should he a meaningful one, i.e., it should be an amount representing not less than one normal increment on the salary scale of the post to which the officer is promoted.

This was mainly due to too many industries operating at the same time, thus causing serious air pollution.

This shows the determination of the Government in this respect. Mr Speaker, Sir, following active economic development, more and more industries have been established. The problem of environmental health then becomes more and more serious. In many advanced cities like Tokyo and New York, air pollution has become an insurmountable problem. It has affected the lives and safety of the people. In the last few years, air pollution tended to increase because of the rapid industrialisation in Singapore. As a result of economic progress, there are more vehicles on the roads, more radio and television sets in Singapore, contributing to more noise pollution which will gradually affect the tranquility and health of our living environment. Before these can seriously affect our living and safety, the establishment of the Ministry of the Environment now is a far-sighted and a very timely proposal.   ",

Civic organisations should systematically and periodically organise campaigns to preserve our environmental health. Vehicles should be regularly serviced and they should use anti-pollution devices. Industries must play their part in preventing pollution by adopting suitable measures and methods and to avoid pollution-causing processes. We must at all cost preserve the cleanliness and wholesomeness of the air in Singapore. Hawkers must also do their bit to prevent the pollution of the environment and the water source. Sir, I must stress that the problem of environmental health can be solved only when we all can see that it is directly related to our standard of living and national safety and when we all can actively and voluntarily adopt early preventive measures. How to make our people realise the close relationship this problem bears to us and how to thoroughly solve it, I think, depend on the effort of all our people.   ",
