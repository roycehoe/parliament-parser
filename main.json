In case the car you are travelling in should develop engine trouble, you can then switch over to the reserve car and continue to your destination. Our largest generator at present has a capacity of 120 MW. To enable the system to continue providing electricity should our largest generator fail, there should be 120 MW generating capacity standing by. This standby is known as spinning reserve.

I must express my regret that the Minister for Finance seems to be trying to ram this Amendment Bill through the House without prior consultation or extending a courtesy to the Estimates Committee. I would rather prefer that sufficient time be extended to the Estimates Committee and that particulars of any change be submitted to that Committee. On that courtesy Members of the Estimates Committee would be able to air their views, and indeed, this was the practice before. I suppose there must be a good reason why this has not been done this time. I do hope that the Hon. Minister would bear my suggestion in mind.   ",

Under the provisions of this Bill, the schedule of notifiable diseases has been widened to include infectious hepatitis, encephalitis and venereal diseases, Although private doctors are required to notify cases of venereal diseases, they do not have to reveal the names and particulars of their patients. The reason for such a step is to encourage infected persons to seek treatment by their own doctors as early as possible.
