**WATER**

**(Necessity for saving)**

  
  
1\. **Mr Ivan Baptist** asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the plentiful rain in the recent pass and the likelihood of more rain as this is the rainy season, there needs to be any apprehension among the public in regard to water rationing or a necessity for them to save water.   
  
**The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San) (for the Prime Minister):** Mr Speaker, Sir, the frequent rainfall which we have experienced since September has replenished our reservoirs which are now 90% full. With the coming of the North-east Monsoon and the promise of more rain. I am glad to say that there is no danger of water rationing in the near future.   
  
However, this does not mean that people can now revert to wasteful habits in the use of water. Whatever the weather, water conservation must be a way of life for us in Singapore. There is a lesson to be learnt from the devastating effects of the unexpected drought in Europe in the last summer. If such a drought could hit Europe, a place hitherto unknown for severe dry spells, the chances of it affecting this part of the world are even greater. We in Singapore, with our limited water storage capacity, cannot afford to wait for a dry spell to threaten before renewing our water conservation habits. Moreover, it is good housekeeping to economise in the use of water which is becoming more expensive to treat and, therefore, to consume.   
  
**Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):** Sir, does the Minister agree that emphasis should always be on not to waste water? During a dry period saving water is essential, but during a period of plentiful rain, saving water males little sense.   
  
**Mr Lim Kim San:** It is a good habit to save water. It is a habit like brushing your teeth every day. Once you have acquired a good habit. I think you should not drop it. To save water is also to save on your F'UB bills and water is getting more expensive to treat. We have exhausted the normal sources of water supply and are going into unconventional means of obtaining water which is going to be more costly. So keep the good habit of saving water.   
  
**Mr Ivan Baptist:** Sir, what I feel is this. Does not the Minister think that wasting water is something that he should emphasise because in actual fact there is -   
  
**Mr Speaker:** Mr Baptist, are you asking a supplementary question or are you expressing your feeling?   
  
**Mr Ivan Baptist:** Sir, does not the Minister want to re-emphasise this business of wasting water rather than saving water? Because to save water, people may have one bath a week, and that is not practical if there is plentiful rain.   
  
**Mr Lim Kim San:** It is a question of emphasis. He can emphasise whichever way he wan!s, so long as he saves water. If one does not waste water, one is already saving water. So it is a question of emphasis. I put it as saving water. He wants to emphasise on the slogan. "Don't waste water." Either way, it means he uses less water.
