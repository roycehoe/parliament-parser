Everybody knows about what is going on and nothing is being done about it. This is partly because the law with regard to corrupt practices, as laid down in our Elections Ordinance, is copied from the English law. Although those laws would adequately protect society from the corrupt politician under English social conditions, they are completely inadequate to deal with the totally different social conditions obtaining in Singapore. The by-elections led to a great number of charges and counter-charges of strong-arm methods, illegal methods, corrupt methods, but no election candidate has filed an election petition against his opponents, nor indeed has anyone made any serious complaint to the police. All this adds up to the fact that unless we radically alter our approach to corrupt practices, then in the next elections and the elections succeeding we will find all these high-handed methods getting completely out of hand.",

Unless we give witnesses a guarantee of secrecy, it is impossible to get these people to come forward in court. For instance, I have a little account book here which has a very close connection with one of the Mak brothers. It records the tea drunk and the cigarettes smoked by about 10 or 12 so-called helpers during the election at the expense of this hon. gentleman. I can prove it but I cannot prove the connection between Mr C. H. Koh and one of these Mak brothers. Therefore I cannot prove that an offence has been committed by Mr C. H. Koh. But if an Inquiry Commission were set up which is not confined to the technicalities of the criminal law of corruption, then some astonishing disclosures could take place.",

No candidate is allowed to put his party emblem. If a man is a candidate he offers himself to his electorate. Here we have had to adopt a different method; we allow party symbols by the side of a candidate's name. The whole of the law relating to corrupt and improper practices is completely unsuitable to our conditions, and we cannot bring the crooks to book with these laws. A commission must be set up to think out ways and means by which we can prevent the democratic system from being subverted by these political adventurers. We have a few ideas as to how they can be effectively detected, punished and suppressed but this is not perhaps the forum for giving these ideas. However, if a proper tribunal is set up, we will have some recommendations to put forward as to how in future we can stop these things.",

Sir, I think the problem is not so easy. Illegal and corrupt practices are very difficult to detect, and while attempting to tidy the law, I doubt very much whether the Commission of Inquiry on corrupt practices is the proper body to look into this matter. I should have thought that probably the hon. Member would have suggested that an All-Party Committee would be the most appropriate body to advise the Government to draft suitable legislation. I say this, Sir, because no member of the Commission would be so fully aware of the corrupt practices which are prevalent during election time than the political Parties themselves.

If a man has to spend $50,000 to $60,000 to fight an election and if he wins and becomes a Minister, you can be sure that he will try to recover four or five times as much - he will be a corrupt Minister. If you want honest Ministers, if you want honest politicians, you cannot expect them to spend $50,000, or $60,000 or $80,000 on an election. If they do, you can be sure what the result is going to be. This is a warning which I am giving to this country; when I see how things are moving - we are following the line of many countries where such malpractices prevail, and it is going to be a sad day for us if we cannot preserve decency and honesty in our politics.",

The public should be told that it is of vital importance for them to come forward and give evidence to this Commission which is to investigate malpractices in the election. If the people want an incorruptible government, if they want their representatives to work honestly for them, they must come forward and give evidence. They should not be expected to have \"Green Spot\" [a soft drink] offered to them or beautiful ladies to entertain them if they want a clean election and a clean government. They should be conscious of their civic responsibilities. So I think this is the time for the Department of Information Services, led by Mr Thomson, to co-operate sincerely and make this Commission of Inquiry a top priority job to investigate corrupt practices, and invite the public to come forward with evidence.

It is not only because of the by-elections that corruption and malpractices have occurred ever since 1948. Why then does the Government not do something about it, or the political Parties do something about it? Is there much purpose in setting up a Commission of Inquiry into corrupt practices? It will serve no purpose. The most that you can get out of it is a Report from the Commission that such and such practices have occurred. But where will all this end? When the general elections come next year, again such accusations will be made; but what could be done about that? Cannot the Government or any political Party do something about it? The setting up of a Commission of Inquiry will not get us very far, although we may be able to find out something from the Report of the Commission. What I think should be done is this: the Government through the Information Services should set up civic centres and teach the people that they should not be corrupted in any election and how to vote. It is a question of the civic course that we give the people. It is not a question of just having a Commission of Inquiry and to say, \"Oh, yes. So and so is corrupted and so and so has offered money for a vote or so.\" Like the Democratic Party in the last general elections which spent as much as $60,000 as the Member for Tanjong Pagar said - I am sorry he did not refer to that particular Party.

It is not a question that by offering money and bribes, you could get yourself into this Assembly. It is your service to the public; it is your sincerity to the public. So I feel that the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry will get us nowhere. The Hon. the Chief Minister has said that the Government is going to abstain from voting and I think I will abstain with them not because I do not support the motion in principle - the motion in itself is good and I will join the Minister for Commerce and Industry to congratulate the Member for Tanjong Pagar in introducing such a motion - but because as the Chief Minister has said that the present Commission of Inquiry is burdened with a heavy job and that in spite of all his appeals only 24 were prepared to come forward and give evidence. Now if you were to burden him with an extra job, it will extend the time of his Commission and where does he land? It might take another year for him to submit a report to this Assembly or to the Government or to the public and by the time when that year comes around all of us may not be here. So why should we extend the time limit of that Commission? Either set up a new Commission to inquire into this particular case or have nothing at all and then give a policy or directive to the Information Services to start civic courses, teach the public civic consciousness, the right to vote and how to vote and that they should not be subject to corruption.",

But from what I can see as a result of the last two elections, I think all the money that has been spent or alleged to have been spent and all the practices of using gangsters, school boys and school girls have not resulted in the way those people who encouraged corruption have wished. I think the voters are now learning the fact that their vote is secret and that their vote cannot be bought; even if they do fall into the temptation of accepting five or ten dollars, they can still go and vote in secret and nobody can touch them. That, to my mind, is the only practical way of getting our people to go and vote as they think fit.",

Since 1948, I have seen a good deal of the dirty side of politics. I have mixed with some dirty people; some of them are out of politics now and others are still with us. It has not always been pleasant but I could not see any alternative. But I have also mixed with some very decent and very good people indeed and I have not much doubt that it is possible always for a decent poor man to beat a corrupt rich man in a straight fight. The high cost of votes has been referred to: it is usually a high cost of votes to the losing candidate. The winning candidate, if he is a decent candidate, does not necessarily have to spend money in that way.",

I feel pretty sure that there are quite a number of things wrong but I am also sure that there are a great many things right. We should not in this Assembly or elsewhere take it that Singapore is tottering on the brink of collapse into a sea of corruption and filth. The standard of living is high in Singapore as compared with many other countries. The standard of public conduct and public life is also high as compared with many other places. Neither the standard of living nor the standard of conduct is perfectly satisfactory. There are certainly things that could be and must be improved but we should not regard ourselves as isolated from decency by bottomless pits of corruption all around us. I do not think that the civil service is in danger of being corrupted and that the Permanent Secretaries would become corrupted because they got a Minister who is not all that he should be. I think they would bring the Minister up to their level if necessary; or at least see that he did not exercise his position in any wrongful way. What is needed, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that good and decent men of principle and character should come forward into politics and take a leading part. Inquiries may show where the dirt exists and laws may do something to clean up the dirt, but no law, no inquiry, indeed nothing, can take the place of high principles and high standards of conduct amongst the leadership of the country. If that is lacking, the laws will not be enforceable. If that is there, the laws in this matter will not make a great deal of difference because they will not be required and that is the word which I want to leave with the House. It is my firm opinion that we have in Singapore an enormous reserve of good and decent people who should be taking part in political life; who hitherto have not taken enough part; and they are the people whom we have got to bring into politics because they are the salvation and the future of this country. I hope that this proposal to examine political life and put it under a microscope will do something to show them that they can come in. They will see that the bad side is not going to get away with things. They will see that there is a future for a clean and decent man to come into political life and serve his country and meet the needs of the people.",

Sir, we are glad to say that the People's Action Party was formed only in November 1954 and that we have not been responsible for any dirt since November 1954.",

He recited a few things like: we broke up one of the Liberal-Socialist meetings. He went on to say - one of his wisecracks today - that he caught a boy named Lee who was tearing down posters at the rate of five dollars per day. Now, Sir, any Party that can afford to pay five dollars per day just to tear down posters must have a lot of reserves and the People's Action Party have not got such financial backing. So I assume that this boy must have been employed by somebody who does have such financial backing. Be that as it may, I am surprised to hear from the Member for Serangoon that the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) caught a boy who confessed to him that he was paid five dollars a day for doing something illegal and that he had never sought to bring this matter to a police station. Now, Sir, on the other hand, one of our boys was slapped at Duxton Hill corner for sticking up our posters. I will say this for the Singapore Police Force, that they traced the man and we are prosecuting him. That is the way to do it. It is no use alleging that illegal acts were committed and doing nothing about it. As I said just now. I can prove the connection between this little account book with one of the Mak brothers but I cannot prove the connection between the Mak boy and the candidate, otherwise this thing would go to a court of law for a proper adjudication to be made on it.",

If we do not see it, then I say that the chances of it happening in the subsequent election are even less. In which case, I say that the battle for the democratic system is lost. If you want the democratic system, certain conditions must be established, otherwise the way is open for dictatorship. My appraisal of the situation is that we have two more tries in Singapore and in the Federation, which will take us about ten years. If by that time the conditions have not been established, time has run out and either a military junta of the nature of Colonel Nasser or a monarchy of the nature of King Hussein of Jordan will emerge as the alternative to a dictatorship of the Malayan Communist Party.",

This is all a dirty business.\" I think the people of Singapore and the people of Malaya had better understand this: we are all involved in this. That is the first thing we must understand. If this system collapses, not only will the Member for Paya Lebar lose his Sembawang Hill Estate with 1,000 housing units, but he will lose it without compensation, and he will lose a few other physical things besides, all of a sudden. It is no use to say, \"Why should I be involved in this? I am going to concentrate on architecture and 7\ufffd per cent. I am not interested in this. I can find honest ways of earning a living. Let us leave this business of being a politician to the rogues, the scallywags, the vagabonds and the adventurers.\" If that happens, let me say this: the democratic system cannot work. A dictatorship must emerge. That dictatorship will probably make things worse, and armed revolution will be its final consummation. It is inevitable. We must bring home to the people that everybody is involved in it. There is no such thing as 'I am not involved,' not even if you are a civil servant with your pension guaranteed. That is the first thing we should tell our civil servants. They are involved; they have got to make the system work or we all perish.",

They have a stake in this system and have to see that it works. It is not going to work once you start introducing other than straightforward competition of political ideals and political ideas. Once you introduce soft drinks, girls in motor cars to take you to the polls, money for votes and strong-arm methods, then I say a dictatorship may be a better alternative to a corrupt, subverted democracy. But I will say one lesson for all of us which all of us must learn. It is not good enough to say, \"Let us find honest men to come forward and lead.\" Honest men will come forward and find that nobody wants them to lead. You must first be honest. You must next have idealism. You must have convictions. Finally you must organise to bring home your convictions to the people. If you just sit back and say, \"I am an honest man,\" and do nothing about it, that is the end of the matter. Nobody will know that you are an honest man. Not only must you be honest and have convictions but you must bring home the fact that you are honest and have convictions and that those convictions are in the public interest before you can win.",

For God's sake, get together, do something and stand for something other than yourselves, because in the next election the stakes are higher. In 1948 the stakes were low. All you could hope to be was the Hon. Mr So and So in the Legislative Council. Then you get invited to a Government House party which is what the English-educated middle class wanted - birthday parties, the Queen's Birthday, and meet the Governor. Either that kind of politician or the other type who gets into the City Council and sits on the Transport Committee, the Hawkers Committee. The stakes were low - chicken-feed. Therefore one does not stick out one's neck too much. Today we have heard from three authoritative sources - three gentlemen who ought to know - if there is anybody in Singapore who ought to know at all - that it has been a dirty business. With the Rendel Constitution, the stakes increased. Now, one could be a Minister, and if one could be a Minister, one could be in charge of A.P. forms, import and export permits, immigration permits, in or out at $500 or $50 per time. One could be in charge of contracts and tenders. The stakes are going up. In the next election, the stakes go up higher because we are taking over the whole internal machinery. Let me put it to these small-time politicians in this way: they are after chicken-feed, $5,000 per bus licence or $50 for a hawker's pitch, and all these little things. One takes a long time to get rich that way, and every time you take a risk, there is a risk of being caught. But if you could be a Minister for Commerce and Industry in a completely internally self-governing administration-",
