I am sure Members of this House will be glad to hear that we will have the 51,000 units of public housing by that date. The progress of our housing programme, according to schedule, has enabled the Government to give accommodation to the majority of applicants who urgently need houses. We have reached the stage where we can offer accommodation to any citizen of Singapore who is eligible to a house if he is not too choosey. However, there are quite a number of people with low income who want to, and should be encouraged to, own their homes too. Unfortunately the flats and houses built by private developers are priced beyond their means. We have therefore now started a scheme whereby two- and three-room flats are sold on instalment at the subsidized prices of $4,900 and $6,200 respectively. At these prices our citizens can choose between buying a car or a house.",

    "text": "The plan for the sale of low-cost flats was announced in February this year, and the Housing and Development Board, as agent of the Government, prepared a pilot scheme for the sale of 2,068 two- and three-room flats. The response so far has been most encouraging. Up to date about 800 flats have been balloted for. Enough publicity has been given to the scheme and I do not propose to go into details. In putting up this scheme it is our intention to see that no abuse arises out of it. Therefore, certain conditions and regulations have to be made pertaining to the sale of these flats. There are enough provisions in this Bill to prevent these flats which are sold on instalments from falling into the hands of speculators and profiteers. The flats are to be sold only to bona fide purchasers who wish to buy a house for their own occupation. There are also provisions in this Bill to ensure that the flats can be managed properly and economically after they have been sold. Under this Bill, a person is not entitled to purchase more than one flat, and if he does so, he contravenes the Ordinance, and on conviction will be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to a fine not exceeding $2,000, or to both fine and imprisonment. Any flat purchased in contravention of the Ordinance will not be registrable. But, on the other hand, provision is made in the Bill to exempt all bona fide transactions from the legal requirements of the Registration of Deeds Ordinance and the Land Titles Ordinance, as regards the registration of sale, mortgage, and re-mortgage.",

Their refusal to do what the P.A.P. want them to do is termed as an act of disloyalty and anti-national. But is it for the ruling clique to say whether the people are disloyal and antinational? The ruling clique is selfish and reactionary. Anyone who dares to fight for the interest of the nation and against the reactionary ruling clique is described as disloyal and anti-national. Mr Speaker, Sir, what is very strange is that these so-called diloyal and anti-national elements are invariably anti-colonial fighters who receive great respect from the nation at large. The Alliance and the P.A.P. Governments hate them and resort to every means to suppress them. Why should this be so? This is because the anti-colonial fighters threaten the interest of the ruling clique and the British and American imperialists.",

    "text": "Mr Speaker, Sir, let me recount to you the history of our people in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism. In 1941 when the Japanese imperialists occupied our country, the British soldiers did not shoulder their responsibility in defending our country. They ran away on hearing the approach of the Japanese. As a result, our people were left entirely to sink or swim. They were massacred by the Japanese. The blood shed was enough to form a stream and the piled-up corpses could form a hill. This was the so-called protection and defence that the British were able to give us during that critical period. As a result, our people of various races had to come forward to defend their nation and their own lives and properties, and they waged the war against the Japanese imperialists and Fascists. With determination and support from many parts of the world, our people were able to defeat the Japanese. After all these difficult experiences, we realise that whatever hardship and suffering we are subjected to are the result of the suppression carried out by the British imperialists. Therefore, in the name of liberation and to break away from the British imperialists, the people were not afraid to go to gaol, to make sacrifices and carry on their relentless struggle against the British imperialists. In these circumstances, the British imperialists experienced certain pressure from the people. They knew that the struggle was going to be very difficult. So in order to prolong their interest and influence in our country, they made use of certain stooges. The policies of the Alliance were not framed to end the British colonial influence. On the contrary, they were framed with a view to consolidating the British and American imperialist influence. That is why the people are against them. We are against Malaysia because of this. We are against the suppression that is now being carried out against the people of North Borneo. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a short history and it has been written in blood. It shows the loyalty that the people have to our nation.",

He said that he escaped this fate because he was very fluent and very convincing in what he said. But unfortunately, thousands of people who were subjected to hardship during the Japanese occupation were not so fortunate with the gift of the gab like our Prime Minister; otherwise they would still be alive today, just like him, and there would be less widows and orphans. When the Japanese went, the British came in, as a result of which the peole launched into the anti-colonial struggle. What did our Ministers do during this period by way of contribution in this struggle? It was through the leadership of the Secretary-General of my Party and the other anti-colonial and anti-imperialist leaders that the Prime Minister had been able to get some support to be what he is now.",

They went into collusion with pro-colonial elements like the Tunku to work for the interest of the British colonialists and they formed Malaysia. They are the No. 1 collaborators of the British colonialists. What right have they to tell us who are and who are not loyal, Mr Speaker? The present tension that is generated in our nation is attributable to the formation of Malaysia by force. What was the idea behind Malaysia? After the Second World War, the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist movement has been gathering momentum in South-East Asia. The cry for liberation and self-determination is resounding throughout this region. The British colonialists knew this trend and in order to continue with and protect their rule in this region, they stated in the 1963 Constitution that Singapore would be given complete internal self-government; Sarawak and North Borneo would be given self-government; and Brunei would be given complete independence. But the British colonialists at that time knew that the progressive I Leftwing movement was very strong and influential and that power would come into the hands of this movement and those people who were against British colonialism. So the British colonialists had no alternative but to entrust power to their agents in order to prolong their interest and influence in this region. They found these agents in the Alliance and the P.A.P. That was how the idea of Malaysia came into being. The ants-progressive elements gathered together and Malaysia was formed. British interests and economic influence have not come to an end as a result of the form ation of Malaysia. On the contrary, they have been further protected. Malaysia was formed to isolate the progressive elements in Indonesia and the national movement in this region. This is precisely in the interest of the imperialists. Mr Speaker, Malaysia was formed against the wishes of the people. According to the Constitution, the people of Singapore cannot enjoy the same status as that of the Federation of Malaya. The people of Singapore do not enjoy the same political rights as those in the Federation. The people of Singapore have no equal representation in the Central Parliament. They do not enjoy freedom of publication, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.",

The colonialists still continue to control the economy of our nation. Bri tish bases are still rampant throughout our nation. Rockets and army installations are very common in our country. Malaysia's foreign policy is pro-Western. It is a pro-war policy. Fundamentally, Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plan. That is why the people of the five territories are against it.

Mr Speaker, in order to fight for their national independence and liberation, the people of North Borneo are now bravely engaged in an anti-British and anti-colonial struggle. Any party or organisation and even individuals who are anti-colonialists should support the people of North Borneo. The British colonialists and the ruling Party in Malaysia should be held responsible for the war that is going on in North Borneo today. The Alliance Government is now forcing the people of Singapore to undergo military training as a preparation before they go to fight in North Borneo. This is against the interest of the people as much as it is in the interest of the British colonialists. The present struggle against the British colonialists in North Borneo is a reasonable one. The British colonialists should be held responsible for the consequences. The fate of the people of Singapore and Malaya is similar to that of the people in North Borneo. They have suffered the same savage suppression. Since we have mutual aspirations and wishes, we should support one another to get rid of this suffering.",

New Zealand, Australia and the United States have joined the British in supporting Malaysia and they have promised to provide arms to Malaysia. However, their young people will not come here to fight the war, because in Britain itself the young people are against conscription. Moreover, the British do not have enough troops to cope with the situation in Malaysia.

The out-of-date armament left over h' the United States and the weapons left behind after the war in Korea are now being handed over to the Alliance Government. The Alliance Government is now trying to arm our people with these out-of-date weapons. Had Dulles known this, he would have laughed in his grave, because his plan of Asian people fighting against Asian people has now been realised. The U.S. Military Mission has come to Malaya to have talks with the Alliance Government. Tun Razak has also said that Malaysia is prepared to send aid to South Vietnam to help the Government there. All this proves that they are irresponsible. All this has been carried out to serve the interests of the foreign powers. That is why they want our people to fight the people in North Borneo. Therefore, in the interest of our people and the interest of the people in North Borneo, I earnestly urge Members of all Parties in this House to forget their party differences and protect the lives and properties of the people by bringing them back from the brink of war.",

But it is now transparently clear in the light of recent developments why the Member for Crawford, Mr S. T. Bani, had insisted that Indonesia should be the heart-land of Malaysia. This underlies all the actions taken and statements made by the Barisan Sosialis - their statements opposing Malaysia and national service and their action in organising a demonstration at Hong Lim Park against national service. All this amounts to really a big sell-out by the Barisan Sosialis of the people of Singapore. What they are asking us is to substitute parliamentary democracy, which they are enjoying here today, for guided democracy; economic progress for economic stagnation and decline. They are asking the people to substitute, or to change over from eating rice to eating corn, and they are asking us to relinquish our independence so that we can come under Indonesian hegemony.",

When the Indonesians sent guerillas to infiltrate the borders of Sabah and Sarawak and even when long-houses were attacked, the Barisan Sosialis came out in support of what was called the \"liberation army\" of Sarawak. In fact, a number of Barisan Sosialis leaders, including the ex-Chairman and Secretary, went across to Kuching and other parts of Sarawak to incite disaffection and raise the standard of rebellion in Sarawak.

This is, in fact, what the Barisan Sosialis are doing. The Barisan Sosialis perhaps would do better to use this opportunity to unite and rally all the races in Malaysia and make this a first-class Opportunity for laying the founda tion for our Malaysian nation, rather than making Malaysia an issue to split the races.

It is not desirable for us to depend all the time on foreign troops to assist us in our defence.

This is possible because the Israelis are aware that the only way they can defend the integrity of their country is to demonstrate an expressive ability to fight and die for their country's independence. Even the neutralism of Switzerland must be defended by military means. Neutralism does not come by itself or is given on a platter to countries which just declare that they are neutral. In Switzerland, young men of 20 years old are called to serve in the militia, and they remain in the militia from the age of 20 years to 50 years during which they undergo periods of military training.

The House may, if it so desires, debate at the same time the original motion as proposed by the mover of the motion, the words to be left out, and the words to be added as proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister. If the House feels that it is convenient to do this, then we may do so. But if the House feels that it wishes to debate the amendment first and then go hack to the original motion, the House may also do that. I am entirely in the hands of the House as to what it proposes to do. Perhaps it might be more convenient if the amendment and the original motion be debated together, and, at the proper time, I shall just put the questions simpliciter. Is that the general view of the House?",

We have brought up our motion in the belief that conscription is against the interests of all the people of Singapore. To force our people to be soldiers and to force them to go to war would only destroy the family lives of our people. It would also separate families. It would cause the loss of many lives and property. More serious than this is the fact that Malaya has been brought into a war to promote the interests of the Anglo-American imperialists and colonialists. We have been involved in an aggressive war in the interests of the imperialists in SouthEast Asia. Through their so-called merger with Malaya the Lee Kuan Yew clique has handed over our political, citizenship, and financial rights to the Central Government in the name of Malaysia.

The Barisan Sosialis' understanding of the liberation war is this - that it is an act by which anti-national elements try to overthrow a constitutional government. The Barisan Sosialis want the people of this country to commit an anti-national act by rising up and destroying the nation. But they do not say so in many words. We have heard also that the Barisan Sosialis adopts the anti-Malaysian stand because we did not accept the advice given by their Secretary-General. The Barisan Sosialis is now left without a Chairman although it has its Secretary-General. I remember hearing that the Barisan Sosialis members are not interested in having a Chairman. That is why their Party is still without one. In fact, one of the members of the Barisan Sosialis has said that he is not interested whether his Party has a Chairman or not.",

At this juncture the Barisan Sosialis should call upon the people to take part in national service to support and defend our country. But they have done otherwise. So they have disqualified themselves as representatives of the people. Furthermore, they have even tried to mislead some students and youths to take part in illegal processions and demonstrations in order to bring further disorder to our country. I remember in the past Mr Chor Kok Thong, a former member of the Barisan Central Committee, saying something about loyalty and democracy. On the eve of leaving Singapore for China, he said that he never showed any loyalty to Singapore and this nation. These are words that have come from a member of the Central Committee of the Barisan Sosialis. He said that he was never loyal to our country.

We have been recognised by many countries in Afro-Asia. But there are still some elements in Singapore, our own country, who still doubt our national integrity and sovereignty, when we already have it. Mr Speaker, this is something that is very puzzling to me. At a time when Indonesian troops are killing and slaughtering our people on the border of Borneo, and at a time when open aggression has been shown by Indonesian landings in Labis, Malacca and Pontian, the Barisan Sosialis have said nothing to condemn the Indonesians. On the contrary, they have turned round to say that we are forcing the people to fight against such aggression. We do not deny that in deal ing with these invaders, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said just now, we have to obtain help from New Zealand and Australia. But this help has been described as a threat to our nation, whereas Indonesia's open aggression is never considered as a threat to us by the Barisan Sosialis. It is very clear that there are Indonesian guerrillas on the border of Sabah and Sarawak trying to disrupt our national security and killing our people. But the Barisan Sosialis have said nothing against it. They say that the Indonesians are part of the Sahah and Sarawak people. This is their logic. It is not so strange as one may seem to think, because the hero in the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Lim Chin Siong, has already suggested a federation between Singapore and Indonesia. By this logic Indonesian guerrilla activities are described by them as acts of heroes fighting for self-determination and national liberation.",

This is a very irresponsible act. The self-determination and sovereignty of a country should be safeguarded by us. We should not depend for too long a time on foreign aid to defend our own rights. National service is a step towards strengthening our military power to protect ourselves. But the Barisan Sosiahis do not like this.

Therefore, we must point out the fallacy uttered by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, in saying that the State Assembly should not debate this question. Why should that be so, since the question involves the lives and property of the people? We are totally opposed to what they have propounded just now. The State Legislature has full rights and is a proper place to discuss the question which is posed before us. The Singapore Government should pay attention to this question which affects the lives and future of the people.",

I have heard the Member for Paya Lebar saying that the formation of Malaysia has brought misers and hardship to the people. If there is any truth in it, it is encouraged and abetted by the Barisan who have collaborated with Indonesia. That the Barisan Sosialis is infiltrated by Communists is an open secret and it is this element which has encouraged Indonesia to confront Malaysia. As early as 1962 the Barisan have openly professed their support of an uprising in Brunei led by Azahari who is now in exile in Indonesia. The Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis. Mr Lim Chin Siong, collaborated with him. The Barisan knew full well that they were not in a position to fight, to capture power by constitutional means, so they chose to capture power by violence. In this connection, the Barisan have spread falsehoods and told Indonesia that the people of Singapore are anti-Malaysia. They hope by this to receive aid from Indonesia in order to help them to capture power. Is that not the truth? However, man proposes, but God disposes. This plot between the Barisan and Indonesia was exposed, and it led to the arrest of Lim Chin Siong and company. Sir, following the arrest, the people came to realise that the Barisan are closely aligned with Indonesian Communists. That is why the people voted them out in the last election. It is common sense, Sir,If they are anti-Malaysia, they should not blame the people of Singapore for voting them out. According to their logic, if the people had been against us - the P.A.P. - they would have voted us out in the last general election. It is the verdict of the people, Sir,If the Opposition had any sense of shame, they should by now have realised and kept their mouths shut.",

As a result of the two recent disturbances in Singapore, people have been longing to live in peace and security. They hated the demonstration sponsored by the Barisan Sosialis. The demonstration failed because the people did not co-operate. This is because the mood of the people has changed. For the sake of the security of the country, everyone longs to take up arms to defend the country against Indonesian aggression. But the people in the Barisan Sosialis, on the other hand, want to pour cold water on the heads of the people. Even the Member for Hong Lim can understand this situation. He dare not support the motion by the Barisan Sosialis. He also understands that times have changed and that there should be a new approach. But the Ban-san Sosialis cannot see that times have changed, and that there should be a new formula to deal with the new situation. Conscription to defend the country is a common system throughout the world. Even Switzerland, which is a nonaligned country pursuing a neutralist policy, has this system in practice. In fact, the conscription now in force in Malaysia has shown us that we are no longer in slavery. Why should we have conscription to defend our own country? It could be left to the masters to defend it. So it is just as what the Barisan Sosialis has said in the past -\"This land is ours. Except for this land we have nowhere to go.\" If this land unfortunately is occupied by Indonesia, then our livelihood will be badly affected. That is the reason why we should protect and defend our country. The Barisan Sosialis argue that our condemnation of Indonesia is a lie. Do they mean that all the Indonesian infiltrators who landed in Labis and Muar were non-existent? We had an exhibition recently in Singapore. It was a very successful exhibition at which weapons like machine-guns supplied by the Indonesian Government were displayed. Do they mean that all these were faked?",

If Indonesia can assure us that it will not invade us; if the whole world can assure us of our safety and security, we, of course, will request the withdrawal of foreign bases. But the question is whether we can get such an assurance from Indonesia, or from the United Nations, to protect our security and safety. If not, then how are we going to protect and safeguard our country? Of course, we will then have to arm ourselves and build up our forces. When we ask foreign countries to help us, to defend us, they turn round to say that it is not proper to do so. Do they mean that they want our country to be handed over to another power before they are contented? The Barisan speakers and their propaganda have been of no avail. They are going into a blind alley from which position they cannot save them selves. Their action is an anachronism. I hope they will mend their ways.",

That is right, because there has been no change in the situation. Our former colonial masters are today still controlling the fate of Singapore and Malaya. Singapore and Malaya are still under the control of colonialism. If there is no change in the situation, then of course we will not change our attitude and words. I admit that the P.A.P. have changed. They are very fond of changing themselves and their position. They could pose as anti-colonialists, and later on they could also become a pro-colonialist Party. They could co-operate with our Secretary-General and they could also sell him out. They could also become a woman to please the Tunku.

But what happened to the British troops then that were described as troops fighting for our interests? Who actually rose to fight against the Japanese? The P.A.P., the Australian troops, or the British troops? I believe, Mr Speaker, they would not have the guts to answer my question. Those who are capable of safeguarding Malaysia are our own people, not foreign troops. The words and utterances of the P.A.P. are not different from those of the imperialists. How can one imagine that the independence and freedom of a nation require the protection of a foreign power?",

Those taking part in that conference resolved on an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from colonial countries. On the agenda of that conference, foreign bases was a topic for discussion. On this mat ter their resolution called upon the imperialists to give up all their military bases in foreign lands. Now, are foreign troops and foreign bases in a position to protect us? The Party in power says that they have got international support and support from Afro-Asian countries. But what are the actual facts? The facts have already been mentioned and they are very clear. One resolution passed at the conference of non-aligned nations was to condemn the existence of foreign bases and foreign troops in colonial countries. And what is most surprising is that the so-called independent Malaysia was not invited to participate in the conference of non-aligned nations in Cairo. Why? It is very clear - it is because Malaysia is pro-colonial and is not on the side of the majority of anti-colonial nations of the world. Instead of fighting against imperialism and colonialism, Malaysia is helping them. That is why Malaysia was not invited to the conference.",

We in principle are against the so-called military defence pact with Britain. If we say that this pact is necessary, then we will be scorned by other independent nations in the world. Just imagine one nation having to resort to foreign military aid in order to safeguard its own integrity. Is it really necessary? Cambodia is a neutral country and is non-aligned. The P.A.P. is proud of it, but has Cambodia signed any military pact with America or Britain to safeguard her own sovereignty? Let us look at South Vietnam which is being bullied by the Americans, The Cambodians do not require any foreign protection. If the Ministers and the Backbenchers of the Government do not recognise this fact, then let me tell them that in Cambodia they have been having some trouble along their border recently because of American stooges in South Vietnam. Ac cording to P.A.P. logic, it appears that Cambodia has to sign a military pact with Britain in order to counter these acts of aggression. No, there is no need. Cambodia does not do so because it wants peace. It is an independent country and it is not isolated internationally. In spite of the fact that it does not have troops or atomic weapons, it can still exist in this world because it has the will and the determination to exist. The people there love peace. They love freedom and they want to preserve their independence. Cambodia has the support of its people and the world.",

    "text": "Now this situation cannot be said to be not serious. You cannot say that this situation does not have any far-reaching consequences and influence on the future of our people. Who is the culprit? Who is to blame for this situation today? Political party propaganda by the other side has claimed that it has been from Indonesia, in two ways: external military aggression and internal subversion. They say that because of this foreign aggression, therefore, we have these ill consequences and this serious situation. Now this is their logic. They have told the people that Malaysia will bring about peace and prosperity. But what is the actual result? The actual result is that Malaysia has brought about pain and suffering and misery, because Malaysia is a product of British neo-colonialism, because it is not in the interests of the people but in the interests of the British colonialists. The Party in power says that it is ridiculous to say so, but even the British people themselves have claimed what I have said not very long ago. A British newspaper, the Observer, published an article saying that Malaysia was a communal arrangement. Not very long ago a British Conservative Party Minister said that Malaysia was very important to Britain. Why? Because Britain has great financial investments in this territory, and also this territory would serve as an important military link and a point of communications in a world-wide network. So from this you can see the motives of the British in setting up Malaysia. It is merely for their own interests.",

He has claimed that most of the investment is in Malaya. Now this goes to prove the point that Britain wanted to set up Malaysia in order to protect its economic interests in Malaya. As I have said, the investment amounts to about \ufffd400 million. It does not matter where most of it lies - in Malaya or in Sabah and Sarawak. If they want to bring Sabah and Sarawak into Malaya, it is because the struggle of the people in these areas against colonialism is gaining momentum. Seeing this situation, the British wanted some agent to look after their interests in this area. Under these circumstances, they formed Malaysia. Because the British point of view is such and the motive is such, it has aroused strong opposition by the people in these five territories, and the people of Sabah and Sarawak have started a struggle against Malaysia. Even in Singapore the people are doing so. How do the Government resort to suppressing this movement? They are closing down and banning the organisations and arresting the people. Under such circumstances, the people of Sabah have no other alternative but to take up arms against the British. No matter how the Party in power may say that this is very terrible and violent. Even in the recent non-aligned nations' conference in Cairo, there was a resolution which stated that colonial territories should be independent as soon as possible. If the colonial powers would not let them be independent, then the colonial people could resort to any means, including force, to achieve independence.",

No matter how the British persuade the Federal Government to do things which meet with the interests of the British, i.e., to form Malaysia and to salvage their sinking political fortunes in this area and to look after their interests, the struggle of the people of Borneo has become stronger and more vehement. I think it will continue until success is achieved. It is only a matter of time before the people will be victorious. There is no doubt that they will get support from various quarters - spiritual support as well as moral support. Perhaps Malaysia will be getting support from the British and elsewhere, as has already happened in the past. For instance, the liberation of West Irian had the support of people in various Asian countries. So the struggle for freedom in Borneo will also receive the support from Afro-Asian countries and all those who love independence and freedom.",
