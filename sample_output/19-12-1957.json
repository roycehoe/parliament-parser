There has also been an improvement as regards the strike situation. I notice that the number of strikes this year is very much less than that of last year. The strike situation has improved quite a lot but one thing I am quite sure, Sir, is that the Government was only prepared to deal with labour strikes and I do not think that the Government ever anticipated that there would be hunger strikes. So Government therefore was not prepared for such an eventuality. I quote, Sir, this instance of a hunger strike. I went to the Singapore Harbour Board Association last night and there I found about 200 employees of the Singapore Harbour Board on a hunger strike. I was there at about 10.00 p.m. and I remained there until 11.45 p.m. I understand that this hunger strike started on Monday, 16th December at 8 p.m. and when I arrived at the Association's premises at 10.00 p.m. last night I was told that about nine of the hunger-strikers had collapsed and had been sent to hospital. From 10.00 p.m. (the time of my arrival) until about 11.45 p.m. when I left there were another three to four of the hunger-strikers who collapsed and I accompanied them to hospital. I believe that by this morning there may be a few more such cases. When I arrived here this morning, I was told that the total number that collapsed from last night till this morning was 13. Out of this 13, I understand that 10 have not returned to the Association's premises. They may or may not be in hospital now. I do not know. What has Government done about this hunger strike, or what is Government going to do about this hunger strike? Have they taken the trouble to investigate into this hunger strike? I understand that this hunger strike is due to the refusal of the Harbour Board to accept the reinstatement of the employees as was recommended by the report of the Court of Inquiry.

The go slow was a general movement and the men followed the instructions of their Union. They have already suffered a loss of wages and overtime benefits. However, the Port is again in full operation and for the promotion of improved industrial relations, we are of the opinion that it is desirable that any such men should be speedily re-employed as the Board will find possible.

This report, Sir, was tabled before this Assembly on 6th September, 1957\\. Three and a half months have passed and Government has not stepped in to find whether the Board has actually reinstated these employees or not. If the Government had done so, I am quite sure that these employees would not have gone on a hunger strike. Since the Government did not take the trouble to do so, and since the Board refused to reinstate them as was recommended in the report, there was no other alternative for these men but to go on a hunger strike. There is no more question of a strike because they are not employed now. So to show their protest, they had to go on a hunger strike. This is one of the legitimate weapons of trade unionists. So they have resorted to the legitimate weapon of trade unionism and they are now on a hunger strike. Sir, if they have no work now, what else can these men do? Can they support their families? Their families have to go hungry because there are no wages and there is nothing at all to be brought home to feed their families. The report says that they have already lost wages and overtime benefits. Sir, is the Government fully aware of all this? Why has the Government not stepped in again? Is the Government going to wait until some death occurs before it will step in? I understand, Sir, that there was also a strike in the Singapore Harbour Board in 1955 and at that time the then Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall) put heavy pressure on the Harbour Board and all the strikers were reinstated. This, I understand, is quite reliable and at that time I think the Member for Tanjong Pagar, the leader of the P.A.P., was also interested and assisted in some way or other to get them reinstated. I believe that the present Chief Minister could also do the same thing and if he were to do so he would be fully justified because he is only accepting the recommendations of the Court of Inquiry.

Members of this House which have not been carried out or met. One of them is the decentralisation of social centres in connection with public relief distribution. Sir, I mentioned last year the case of a poor man living in the island of Pulau Tekong who asked for public assistance.

One thing which we witness is that many trade unions seem to rely upon the advice of politicians or men from the legal profession in connection with their activities. Sir, I think that is a great mistake. I think that trade unions should invite economists to advise them in their activities rather than politicians. May I put forward to the Government a suggestion whether they would consider sponsoring a training class for union leaders?

The Singapore Harbour Board wrote to all employees concerned asking them to report to the Labour Office; the Singapore Harbour Board would then consider reemploying them. Some went - I do not know how many because I do not have the figures available to me here - and when they went, of course, they were asked by the Singapore Harbour Board labour officer certain questions. The trade unionists, I understand, took umbrage that such questions should have been asked. The Singapore Harbour Board, when questioned by me, told me that surely they had a right to ask an employee or even an ex-employee who had been going on a \"go slow\" for so long and causing so much economic damage to the country whether he would work and work properly for the Singapore Harbour Board. It would appear that the workers resented that; that they should not be told that they should work and work properly for their wages. They took umbrage. The Union or, I should rather say, the General Secretary of the Union advised these workers not to report - \"not to report\" - and surely can one blame the Singapore Harbour Board for not considering re-employing people who did not make an appearance and declare that they wanted re-employment? Can we blame the Singapore Harbour Board? I am indeed very unhappy to have to take sides as I said earlier. The workers did not report. They said, \"We must go in as a body.\" Did they say that? I do not think they said that. It was the General Secretary of the union saying that, in order that he was not going to suffer any loss in prestige or the respect of the workers who were led by him for whatever damage he had done. They stuck firm and I got in touch with the Board again and again. The answer given to me was, \"If they do not make an appearance and if they do not declare that they desire to be re-employed, how can we re-employ them?\" So I said, \"All right, I will advise the workers to go back and register and then I will ask you to give immediate and sympathetic consideration to take them back.\" I advised the union accordingly but this particular General Secretary - this man who has led them for his own good, I am sorry to say - tried to cash in on the situation and led all the workers as a mass into the Singapore Harbour Board and said, \"We now demand re-employment.\" I told them, \"That is not the way to go about it. There is no longer any fight. You want re-employment, go and register quietly. Do not seek publicity. There is no reason why you must feel that this man who has led you or misled you should have his own position protected and should be given the opportunity to be able to tell other workers and thereby mislead them, 'It was I who brought them back to the Singapore Harbour Board.' \" Surely, as an employer and even as a worker, no organisation can give in to intimidation and it should not give in to intimidation. Even if the employers were to intimidate any trade union organisation, that organisation must resist to the bitter end in the same way as the Singapore Harbour Board resisted by saying, \"If you want to get publicity and play this kind of a stunt with us, sorry, boys, we cannot register you.\" Then they got in touch with the T.U.C. The T.U.C. got in touch with me. Later they came to see me and I told them that things could have been solved and would be solved if they would just forget all about their prestige and all about the desire, particularly of the General Secretary, to pull himself out of the fire. Since they got in touch with the T.U.C. and then myself, I went to the extent of saying, \"I will undertake to have it done.\" Many reports appeared in the local papers condemning my inaction. There was even a march to my office when I was away and there was this Jamit Singh carrying a baby trying to get publicity and trying to intimidate the Minister himself into trying to help him out of a difficulty which he himself had created. I too will not tolerate intimidation and I too will never give in to intimidation. The T.U.C., the Chairman of the Harbour Board and myself had a discussion and we came to some arrangement. I felt that the sooner this General Secretary was kept totally away from all these things the easier would it be for all things to be solved but no, in spite of the discussion and the hope of a solution, the next morning it was reported in the same paper that they had taken a vote to go on a hunger strike. Is that not another method of intimidation? We have assured this union, \"Please, I feel just as much as you feel for these workers. What we want is to see these workers get back to work.\" You can call the Minister a rotten man; I will take it. You can call me any names; I will take it but I find it very difficult to have to tell the press all these things that have been done by this so-called leader of the workers. I did not wish to expose him because I felt in exposing him it would strengthen the hand of the Harbour Board and it would make things more difficult. We know that, although it has not been officially said, it is felt that the clash between this and that is just a clash of personalities. That is unfortunate and I do not like it. But then as a Minister, it is my duty to try and make personalities forget themselves and sink their differences in the bigger things. Every time we tried to pull off something, something else was being done by this paper to damage what we had been doing and, in spite of all that we have done, we now have the Member for Queenstown ask, \"What has Government done? Is Government going to allow these people to die from hunger?\" Government, particularly myself as the Minister for Labour, wants to do a job quietly without hurting anyone because it does not pay to hurt workers or employers in the scheme of things. We must try to bring about better understanding and in trying to bring about better industrial relations one must try not to run down one organisation or the other. That should never happen, and now it is suggested that the Government should call off the hunger strike. I cannot understand that and I say this again, \"If this so-called trade union leader and if the responsible leaders in the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association will just keep away from seeking publicity and will just forget everything in order that these people can be re-employed, the Government will see that they are re-employed.\"", "section": "transcript", "transcript_tag": "contd_text", "attendance_tag": null, "speaker": "**Dr Lim Yew Hock:**", "title": null, "subtitle": null, "speech_type": null}, {"line": 685, "text": "", "section": "transcript", "transcript_tag": "blank", "attendance_tag": null, "speaker": "**Dr Lim Yew Hock:**", "title": null, "subtitle": null, "speech_type": null}, {"line": 686, "text": "**Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):** Mr Speaker, Sir, I read the morning press with some interest when I discovered that three leading politicians had suddenly taken an interest in the hunger strike at the Singapore Harbour Board and they all happened by some strange coincidence to follow one another into the union's premises: The Member for Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng, the Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) and the former Member for Cairnhill (Mr D.

The strike went on for 60 odd days and was finally concluded to the advantage of the workers. Then in late 1955, it was decided to expand the membership of that union and take in the daily-rated workers. There were 2,000 odd monthly-rated workers and there were 7,000 to 8,000 daily-rated workers. Amendments were subsequently made to the constitution and the workers were to be registered as members of the Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association. Mr Jamit Singh felt however that it might be better to have some other name and formed a union called the Singapore Harbour Board Workers' Union. He started registering workers for that union. This is the crux of the matter: there is a fight in the Singapore Harbour Board. In the course of a fight, one makes use of every possible source of support. All expendable material is used, be it David Saul Marshall, whom the General Secretary of the union denounced three nights ago on a P.A.P. platform in Jalan Besar. If David Saul Marshall thinks he wants to cash in on it, the General Secretary quite rightly says, \"Good, you want to play me for a sucker, I will play you for a sucker.\" This is a tough game and those who are not tough, had better not try to play this game. There was a real fight, and the fight was between Mr Chrimes, as Chairman of the Singapore Harbour Board, and Mr Jamit Singh. Mr Chrimes believed - and I am sure he still does to this day - and I have heard it said in an aside during the Court of Inquiry which sat for days on end, \"Mr Jamit Singh is a saboteur determined to wreck the Singapore Harbour Board, to bring it to a standstill and to ruin the economy of the country, and is a person who should be put behind bars.\" That is Mr Chrimes' honest to God opinion.

Thousands of formal applications could have been made and the answer would have been 'No'. There was a fight already on in 1956. So the merger which was intended of the Staff Association into the Workers' Union was stalled because merger meant losing the union premises and in any massive organisation, premises are important.

The Board retaliated immediately, looking for an opportunity to bring the matter to a head and detain Mr Jamit Singh's pass. The fight was on.

On the question of labour stability, I did put forward a suggestion to the Minister for Labour and Welfare that we should now sponsor a training course for union leaders whereby the workers themselves can select their own leaders instead of politicians. As we know, some politicians fully utilise the union movement and they can even put one of their own men as a General Secretary. In this instance, I wonder if the Member for Tanjong Pagar can answer these questions. He said that Mr Jamit Singh was selected as the General Secretary to lead the Singapore Harbour Board Workers' Union because he was a very enthusiastic socialist. Did he become a member of the P.A.P.? Is it in the best interest of the workers to establish a new union knowing very well that there is already a trade union existing? Did the legal adviser to the Singapore Harbour Board Workers' Union advise them that they should join the T.U.C.? If we allow politicians to appoint their Party stalwarts into a union and if they want to grab power and make political capital out of labour, I think the stability of the trade union movement can never be achieved. Therefore, I strongly suggest to the Government to consider the sponsoring of training courses for trade union leaders.

The Member for Tanjong Pagar said, \"It is the fight for survival,\" - the fight of survival of his own political Party. Independents are not interested at all. The Independents are only interested in the humanitarian side of trade unions and not in the survival of any political party. So I would strongly advocate that Government start a sort of a course or get lecturers to advise or lecture to trade unions so that they will not accept the advice of politicians who come into trade unions as supposed trade union leaders.

To be a good organiser of a trade union requires knowledge of organisation, ability and experience and this, I think, is in short supply in Singapore. Not only are the technical skills or technological aids short, but also absent is the long tradition of how to do things, how to negotiate, how to strike a bargain, how to understand the workings of an industry, and so on. The result is that unions very often do not get the finest quality of people as organisers, because such people have already gone for more remunerative or more attractive occupations somewhere else. They do sometimes get a man with a chip on his shoulder, a man with an inferiority complex - suffering from a complex of aggressive and defensive mechanisms which do not operate in a fully sane way. He may be inspiring on some occasions, but on others he may be rather a menace. Such a man may get things in a muddle.

That is the first quality and the first difficulty is to find a man with that idealism and that drive. Sir, if we could find more and more of such people, there will be no danger. Then we can make such people work the democratic trade unionism. Then there is every reason to believe that the democratic system in Malaya will flourish.
